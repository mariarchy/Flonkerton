##### Notes
**After cloning the repo & opening the project in Unity**
Apply the `Flonkerton_Scene` (look for `Flonkerton_Scene.unity`)

**If you're getting errors about missing files, materials, sprites, etc.,**
1. Go to `Edit -> Project Settings -> Editor`
2. Version Control: **Visible Meta Files**
3. Asset Serialization: **Force Text**
4. Delete the `Flonkerton-Style/Library` directory and re-open the project.

**If that big Office image in the middle of the map is annoying you**
* In the Hierarchy, `Menus-Text -> PanelStart` and uncheck it in the Inspector
* Do the same with `Menus-Text -> PanelGameOver`
* **REMEMBER** to check the panels before you build/play the game!
